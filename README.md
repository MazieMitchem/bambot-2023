# BAMBOT-2023

This repository stores all published code from my 2023 research involving the 'BAMBOT', a convolutional neural network trained on Google Earth satellite 
imagery capable of identifying invasive bamboo stands. The machine learning algorthim itself is designed to be implemented in concordance with the Google Earth application programming interface 'Earth Engine'.
